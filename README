Most of the detailed documentation (and examples) are in mygpio.ino.

  mygpio.ino - this is the source code for the program in the ESP32
  mygpio.py  - this tool communicates to the arduino via (virtual) serial

Note that compiling "mygpio.ino" requires the following files to be present in the current working directory :

  LiquidCrystal_I2C.h
  LiquidCrystal_I2C.cpp
