The "mygpio.ino" is firmware designed to run on the Espressif ESP32. 

  - provides a web interface (via REST) to controlling your ESP32.
  - configuration is stored as files in the ESP32's SPIFFS filesystem.
  - provides a "/metrics" endpoint for prometheus scrapes.
  - publishees and subscripbes to MQTT (optional).
  - schedules user defined threads.

Most of the detailed documentation (and examples) are in mygpio.ino.

  mygpio.ino - this is the source code for the program in the ESP32
  mygpio.py  - this tool communicates to the arduino via (virtual) serial
